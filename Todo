Ellipse:
    Fix the elliptical coil math, something is not right. A practically circular elliptical coil should give same values on all C's?
    Fix elliptical C/leg drawing in the capacitor graph
    Add multiple C results on results tab
    Add the text & b1 image on the results tab
    When done re-add the Options menu item to be able to switch between circle ellipse

Set focus on tabs when clicking them (switching tabs), instead of widgets in the tab
Add config. Saving/loading the settings for a specific coil
Break the tab gui classes into more methods for readability
