# pyBirdcagebuilder


## The design
This project contains pyBirdcagebuilder, a program that calculates ideal capacitor values for birdcage coil designs.

The program is based on the [Birdcage Builder program by PennState Health](https://research.med.psu.edu/departments/center-for-nmr-research/software/birdcage-builder-web-app/) which they have provided for free for a long time, but is becoming increasingly difficult to run on modern computers. Therefore I have decided to make a new open source version based on Python3, to ensure future compatibility.

An [alpha version](../../tree/ellipse_alpha) is available in the ellipse_alpha branch. This version makes it possible to calculate values for elliptical birdcages. Only short-axis elliptical birdcages are available for now.

## Download and use
Download the project and run the Python script (pyBirdcagebuilder.py). You might have to install Python before you can run it. [(Download)](http://www.python.org/downloads)

Alternatively, on the [release page](../../releases) a Windows executable is available for download.
