# pyBirdcagebuilder


## The design
This project contains pyBirdcagebuilder, a program that calculates ideal capacitor values for a birdcage coil designs.

The program is based on the [Birdcagebuilder program by PennState Health](https://research.med.psu.edu/departments/center-for-nmr-research/software/birdcage-builder-web-app/) which they have provided for free for a long time, but is becoming increasingly difficult to run on modern computers. 

The program is written in Python3. 


## Download and use
Download the project and run the Python script (pyBirdcagebuilder.py). 

You might have to install Python before you can run it. [(Download)](http://www.python.org/downloads)
